## About

The **CompleteJava** repository is designed to be a one-stop resource for learning Java. It covers a broad range of topics, providing code examples, explanations, and practical exercises to enhance your Java programming skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Basics**: Introduction to Java syntax, data types, operators, control flow statements, etc.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Collections Framework**: Implementation and usage of Java Collections including lists, sets, maps, and queues.
- **Concurrency**: Threads, synchronization, concurrent collections, and other concurrency utilities.
