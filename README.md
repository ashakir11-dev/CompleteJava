This repository covers main training material for JAVA/Spring

It covers the following:

- Basic Syntax and Language Constructs: Variables, data types, operators, control flow (if-else, switch), loops (for, while, do-while), arrays, and methods.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Exception Handling: try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords for handling errors and exceptions.
- Collections Framework: Interfaces such as List, Set, Map, and their implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.).
- Generics: Writing classes and methods that can work with different types specified at compile time.
- Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces: Functional programming features introduced in Java 8, including java.util.function package interfaces like Predicate, Consumer, Function, etc.
- Concurrency: Thread class, Runnable interface, synchronization, volatile keyword, java.util.concurrent package for higher-level concurrency utilities.
- Input/Output (I/O): InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, File, Scanner, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter for handling file operations and input/output streams.
- Annotations: Built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings, etc.) and creating custom annotations.
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Basics of how Java programs are executed, memory management (heap, stack), garbage collection.
- Java EE (Enterprise Edition): Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), JPA (Java Persistence API), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for web and enterprise application development.
- Java 9+ Features: Modules, var keyword, new API enhancements, and other language updates.
- Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Bean Management with @Component, @Service, @Repository
- Spring Boot Autoconfiguration and Embedded Servers
- Spring MVC: Model-View-Controller architecture, @RequestMapping
- Data Access with Spring Data JPA, JDBC, MongoDB, Redis
- Spring Security: Authentication, Authorization, Custom Providers
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for Cross-cutting Concerns
- Testing with JUnit, Mockito, @SpringBootTest
- Spring Integration for Messaging and External Systems
